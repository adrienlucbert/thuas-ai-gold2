# 2D Car Genetic Algorithm

This is the second gold achievements for the Artificial Intelligence class in 
THUAS' Game Development & Simulation minor.

## Instructions

Make a genetic algorithm optimize a car's ability to progress through a terrain.

### Requirements

- Generate generations of a minimum of 10 cars
- Make use of the fitness function and other predefined functions (in source script)
- Introduce at least 2 more variables

## Credits

This project is the work of [Adrien Lucbert](https://github.com/adrienlucbert),
and the Artificial Intelligence class was given by Dave Stikkolorum.
